I obtained this template from the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) project.
Big thanks to the maintainers listed below for developing this beautiful site template and keeping it open-source.


## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/master/LICENSE).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](https://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
